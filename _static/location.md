Our hotel this year is the beautiful [Courtyard Long Beach Downtown](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lgbcy-courtyard-long-beach-downtown/), at 500 East First Street, Long Beach, CA 90802.

We have a discounted room block for CrossingsCon attendees at the Courtyard. (Instructions on getting a room will be posted once we have the link.)

If you cannot get a room in the room block, please [let us know]({{site.baseurl}}/about/contact). Space is limited, but we want to try to find a place for everyone who wants to attend.
