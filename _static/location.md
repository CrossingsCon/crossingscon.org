Our hotel this year is the beautiful [DoubleTree by Hilton Montreal](https://doubletree3.hilton.com/en/hotels/quebec/doubletree-by-hilton-montreal-YMQDTDT/index.html), at 1255 Jeanne-Mance, Montréal, Québec, Canada, H5B 1E5.

[We have a discounted room block for CrossingsCon attendees](https://tinyurl.com/cc22hotel) at DoubleTree from {{ site.data.date.full }}. Rooms are $239 CAD per night, which is about $185 USD at current rates.

If you cannot get a room in the room block, please [let us know]({{site.baseurl}}/about/contact)! Space is limited, but we want to try to find a place for everyone who wants to attend, and we will make every effort to get you into the room block or find something nearby.
