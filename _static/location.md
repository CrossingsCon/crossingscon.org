Our hotel this year is the beautiful [Courtyard Long Beach Downtown](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/lgbcy-courtyard-long-beach-downtown/), at 500 East First Street, Long Beach, CA 90802.

We have a discounted room block for CrossingsCon attendees at the Courtyard from August 4-7, 2016. Book your room by [clicking here](http://www.marriott.com/meeting-event-hotels/group-corporate-travel/groupCorp.mi?resLinkData=CrossingsCon%202017%5Elgbcy%60cccccca%7Cccccccb%60169%60USD%60false%604%608/4/17%608/7/17%607/15/17&app=resvlink&stop_mobi=yes). The room block will be open until July 15, 2017.

If you cannot get a room in the room block, please [let us know]({{site.baseurl}}/about/contact)! Space is limited, but we want to try to find a place for everyone who wants to attend, and we may be able to expand the room block or find something nearby.
