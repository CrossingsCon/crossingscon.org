---

Depending on how far away you're coming from, there are a bunch of different ways to get to CrossingsCon!

## By air
The closest airport to CrossingsCon is the **Long Beach Airport (LGB)**. Many airlines, including American Airlines, Southwest, Delta, and jetBlue fly to LGB. From there, it's 6 miles to the hotel. Unfortunately there is no hotel shuttle, but you can take a cab or a public bus to the hotel from the airport. Long Beach busses [are accessible](http://lbtransit.com/Guide/Accessibility.aspx) and will drop you off a half-block from the hotel.

You can also fly into **Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)**, which is 23 miles away. There is likewise no hotel shuttle, but public transportation to the hotel is available, and there are a number of private services that will shuttle you to the hotel. More information can be found under "Driving Directions from Airport" on [this page](http://www.marriott.com/hotels/fact-sheet/travel/lgbcy-courtyard-long-beach-downtown/).

## By road
