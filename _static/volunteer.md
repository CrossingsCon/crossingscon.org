CrossingsCon is an entirely volunteer-run organization, and we're always looking for new people to join the team to help make our shared dream a reality.

If you're interested in helping out with the convention, submit the application form at [tinyurl.com/crossingscon-app](https://tinyurl.com/crossingscon-app) or contact <a href="mailto:hiring@crossingscon.org">hiring@crossingscon.org</a> if you have any questions.
