CrossingsCon is looking for volunteers to help make the convention a reality, and our sister project Linguistics After Dark is also currently in need of volunteers. Here's what we're looking for right now:

- **Marketing Lead**: In this position, you will plan and implement a marketing strategy for CrossingsCon. You'll be collaborating with our Head of Marketing & Design, and with 3-5 other people in the design and PR departments, as well as support from the rest of the staff.
<!-- - **Graphic Designer**: In this position, you will create and use brand-consistent (CrossingsCon and Linguistics After Dark) design elements for social media and for at-con items such as signage, merchandise, and program booklets. You'll be collaborating with our Head of Marketing & Design, in a design team of 2-3 people, plus another 2-3 people in the larger department of marketing/social media/PR, with support from the rest of the staff. -->
- **Social Media Manager**: In this position, you will engage with social media platforms on behalf of Linguistics After Dark (LxAD) and/or CrossingsCon (CC), posting original content and sharing and/or engaging with other users’ posts. You’ll be working with the existing social media teams, including Sarah (LxAD) and Kayla (CC), and with graphic design help from the rest of the design team.
- **Audio/Video Editor**: In this position, you will be working with videos and podcast episodes by trimming beginnings and ends, adding title cards, and possibly adjusting sound if needed. You’ll be part of a video/caption team of 3-4 people, working on video panels from previous CrossingsCon conventions and new Linguistics After Dark episodes as they are recorded.
- **Captioning/Transcription**: In this position, you will check auto-generated captions for accuracy and add speaker tags as necessary, as well as reformat captions to a readable transcript. You'll be working in a video/caption team of 3-4 people, with support from the rest of the staff. Most captioning work is on recorded panels from previous CrossingsCon conventions.
<!-- - **Guest Liaison**: In this position, you will be the main communicator between the convention and our guests of honour. This includes reaching out to prospective guests to see if they're interesting in being featured at the con, managing contract negotiations with guests, keeping signed guests up to date with convention details, planning guests' travel and accomodations, and keeping tabs on and managing guests' needs at the convention. -->
- **Events/Programming Coordinator**: In this position, you will plan, schedule, and facilitate activities and events that take place at CrossingsCon. (You don't have to facilitate all of them! Bi-location is not required, though it would certainly be a valuable asset =P) You'll be collaborating with Emma, our Head of Guevents, in a guests/events team of 3-4 people, with support from the rest of the staff.
<!-- - **Guest Liaison**: In this position, you will research potential guests for CrossingsCon, coordinate contracts with them, and facilitate their travel to/from + experience at the convention. You'll be collaborating with Emma, our Head of Guevents, in a guests/events team of 3-4 people, with support from the rest of the staff. -->
