CrossingsCon is proud to welcome our guests of honor for 2021!

If youâ€™re not familiar with the works of some of our guests, our staff put together <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pdfs/where_to_start_guests.pdf">a guide on where to start</a> with each of their respective bibliographies, including some reviews. Take a look!

{% for guest in site.data.guests %}
<div class="row py-3">
  <div class="col-12 col-md-3">
    <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/guests/{{ guest.image }}" alt="A picture of {{ guest.name }}">
  </div>
  <div class="col-12 col-md-9">
    <h5 class="mt-3 mt-md-0">{{ guest.name }}</h5>
    {{ guest.bio | markdownify }}
  </div>

{% endfor %}
