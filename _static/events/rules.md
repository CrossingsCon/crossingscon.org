The main focus of CrossingsCon is to hang out and have fun! But there is also a code of conduct we expect our attendees, staff, and guests to adhere to so that the convention stays fun for everyone.

## Convention Rules

Keep to these rules and we’ll be able to avoid speeding up entropy, at least in our corner of the universe:

1. Respect your cousins.
1. Don’t harass anyone.
1. Don’t spoil anyone on anything - especially Mark Oshiro!
1. What is illegal outside the convention is illegal inside the convention.
1. Children 12 and under should be accompanied by an adult 18 or over.
1. Costumes should be safe enough to accidentally bump into and not get hurt.
1. Always check your name before doing a spell.
1. Listen to convention staff when they ask you to do something (or stop doing something).


Failure to observe these rules will result in appropriate action being taken by staff, up to and including revocation of your badge and ejection from convention space at the extreme. If there is a disagreement, the ruling of the convention chair is final.

If you have any questions about our rules and policies, [contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/about/contact)! We'd hate to have misunderstanding that could have been avoided.

## Anti-harassment Policy

In order to make sure that everyone is on the same page about what is and isn’t harassment, how to report harassment, and what will happen if someone reports harassment, here is CrossingCon’s anti-harassment policy:

**If someone’s behavior makes you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or unwelcome, that is harassment.**

CrossingsCon does not tolerate harassment of any kind, including (but not limited to) behaviors such as: stalking, hate speech, bathroom policing, inappropriate or unasked-for contact, or taking pictures without permission. The aforementioned hate speech could be in reference to: race or ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, marital or relationship status, pregnancy, gender presentation or identity, sexual or romantic orientation, appearance or body type, or disability. This is not an exhaustive list.

Keep your hands to yourself. Ask before hugging. Watch what you say, how you say it, and how people react to it. Remember that cosplay is not consent: the way someone dresses doesn’t give you license to touch them (or their costume) or take pictures of them without asking first. **If you ask and they say no, respect that.**

If you feel harassed, you are welcome to ask your harasser to stop, if you feel comfortable doing so. Otherwise, find a CrossingsCon staff member and report the harassment. Once notified, the staff member will do what is necessary in their judgement to stop the harassing behavior, up to and including revocation of the harasser’s badge and ejection from convention space. We will also, if you like, take steps to help you feel safe again, like escorting you to a place you feel safe or calling your friends or family for you.

This policy applies without exception to everyone at the convention, including attendees, special guests, convention staff, and venue staff.

## Spoiler Policy
Can't tell you this yet. Spoilers!
