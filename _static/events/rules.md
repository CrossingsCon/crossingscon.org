The main focus of CrossingsCon is to hang out and have fun! But there is also a code of conduct we expect our attendees, staff, and guests to adhere to so that the convention stays fun for everyone.

## Convention Rules

Keep to these rules and we’ll be able to avoid speeding up entropy, at least in our corner of the universe:

1. Respect your cousins.
1. Don’t harass anyone.
2. Don’t spoil anyone on anything!
3. What is illegal outside the convention is illegal inside the convention.
4. Children 12 and under should be accompanied by an adult 18 or over.
5. Always check your name before doing a spell.
6. Listen to convention staff when they ask you to do something (or stop doing something).

Failure to observe these rules will result in appropriate action being taken by staff, up to and including a ban from the virtual convention space at the extreme. If there is a disagreement, the ruling of the convention chair is final.

If you have any questions about our rules and policies, [contact us]({{site.baseurl}}/about/contact)! We'd hate to have misunderstanding that could have been avoided.

## Virtual Convention Rules
Since 2021 is the first virtual CrossingsCon, there are several rules that are unique to this year and the virtual convention space.

The public spaces in the virtual convention space will be considered all-ages

The following topics and activities must be contained to a GatherTown private space containing only other con-goers that are comfortable with engaging with the activity or topic. Private spaces are special areas where only the people in the private space can hear and see each other, and not any passers-by.
- On-screen consumption of controlled substances such as alcohol or tobacco, regardless of the legal age of consumption in the person's country of residence.
- Discussion of 18+ topics such as sex, kink, alcohol or cannabis use, etc. Note that this does not include discussions of sexuality or one's experience with gender, which are actively welcomed in all-ages spaces.

## Anti-harassment Policy

In order to make sure that everyone is on the same page about what is and isn’t harassment, how to report harassment, and what will happen if someone reports harassment, here is CrossingCon’s anti-harassment policy:

**If someone’s behavior makes you feel unsafe, uncomfortable, or unwelcome, that is harassment.**

CrossingsCon does not tolerate harassment of any kind, including (but not limited to) behaviors such as: stalking, hate speech, bathroom policing, inappropriate or unasked-for contact, or taking pictures without permission. The aforementioned hate speech could be in reference to: race or ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, marital or relationship status, pregnancy, gender presentation or identity, sexual or romantic orientation, appearance or body type, or disability. This is not an exhaustive list.

Watch what you say, how you say it, and how people react to it. Remember that cosplay is not consent: the way someone dresses doesn’t give you license to take pictures of them without asking first. **If you ask and they say no, respect that.**

If you feel harassed, you are welcome to ask your harasser to stop, if you feel comfortable doing so. Otherwise, find a CrossingsCon staff member and report the harassment. Once notified, the staff member will do what is necessary in their judgement to stop the harassing behavior, up to and including banning the harasser from convention space. We will also, if you like, take steps to help you feel safe again, like escorting you to a place you feel safe or calling your friends or family for you.

This policy applies without exception to everyone at the convention, including attendees, special guests, convention staff, and venue staff.

GatherTown, the platform we will be using for the virtual convention, allows a user to block the audio and video of other individuals in the space, and we recommend using this feature to completely stop a harasser from contacting you in the convention space if the need should arise.

## Spoiler Policy
Please be aware that other attendees at the convention may not be as up-to-date as you are with books, movies, fanfiction, and other media. You should be more careful about recently released books, movies, comics, etc. Use your judgment for what counts as “recent”; in general, the longer something takes to consume (books > movies > TV episodes, for example), the longer you want to assume most people aren’t caught up.

Please be especially mindful of your cousins who haven’t read the Young Wizards series as far as you, both the main series and other works such as <em>Interim Erranty</em> or the <em>Feline Wizards</em> series, and stop before spoiling something for them! Remember the wonder you felt when you first read Young Wizards, and let them experience that too.

We will have some events where spoilers are explicitly allowed, but for the rest of the convention please avoid spoilers entirely if possible. If you want to discuss spoilers about a book, movie, or other piece of media, please do so in a private conversation away from any other attendees who may overhear and be accidently spoiled, and especially avoid spoilers during panels and discussions when many attendees can hear you. If you accidentally spoil someone, apologize and move the remainder of your discussion to another location. If you are unsure whether everyone in a certain conversation has seen or read the thing that you would like to discuss, then ask!

Spoilers aren’t limited to revealing future plot points. Consider this [comprehensive guide](http://markreads.net/reviews/about/) by the folks over at Mark Reads for examples of more subtle kinds of spoilers:
<ul>
    <li>Stating something that happens in the future. <em>“That character dies in book two!”</em></li>
    <li>Hinting that something happens in the future. <em>“I just love what happens when that door finally opens!”</em></li>
    <li>Saying that a specific moment is important. <em>“You’ll want to remember that line of dialogue for later.”</em></li>
    <li>Defending a character because they are redeemed in the future. <em>“That character totally has a reason to be super mean right now!”</em></li>
    <li>Telling someone that the “answer” is in a book they’ve read. <em>“Go back to book 3 and it’ll all make sense.”</em></li>
    <li>Saying, hinting at, discussing, referring to, or ambiguously clueing someone into something they haven’t read yet. <em>“Have you figured out the thing with the birds yet?”</em></li>
    <li>Telling someone they interpreted a scene wrong or that their prediction is proven wrong later. <em>“It only seems that way because you haven’t read Book 6.”</em></li>
</ul>
