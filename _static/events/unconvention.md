An unconvention is an event at a con where attendees present to their fellow attendees, talking about whatever they want: from poetry slams to animal sustainability to kite flying, anything and everything is welcome.

Like previous years, we'll be blocking off time on several different days of CrossingsCon 2021 for unconventions. You can sign up for up to two 30-minute slots [at this link](https://calendly.com/emfozzing/unconvention?month=2021-08).
