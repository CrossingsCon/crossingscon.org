We're always on the lookout for cousins with good ideas! Tell us what you want to do at the con and we'll get back to you to work out the details. You can submit your activity ideas using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf8lJBH8NTmf5ixCQoi8UuOdhEry3wVM_p6zT5yx5Dpze05Vw/viewform?fbclid=IwAR35yPjVwgPXyYXONCqP3yn5BDQXkNfYZyv_FiXOqzh0PX1THQEhhQYxh_I).

The more unique and detailed your idea is, the better chance it will be accepted. That said, we are also looking for cool, out-there ideas some ambitious cousin is willing to put together. Our most memorable events, like the Cousins Jam Session and the Tea Tasting were ideas that our attendees came up with!

The form will close before the convention, so get your ideas in sooner rather than later. We can't wait to hear from you!
