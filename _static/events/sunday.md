As former CrossingsCon goers will know, every con we have two days of panels and talks, and one day of an offsite event related to the books! This offsite event is on Sunday, and this year we have a great place to visit with you: the Space For Life.

The Space for Life is made up of a Biodôme<sup>*</sup>, Insectarium, Botanical Garden and Rio Tinto Alcan Planetarium to form a place where nature and science are honoured: a Space for Life. It’s a participatory movement in which communities here and elsewhere are invited to participate. And it’s also a commitment to protect our planet’s biodiversity. Check out their [website](http://espacepourlavie.ca/en) for more information.

The Space for Life is dedicated to guarding life and protecting growth, so we hope you can see why we chose the Space for Life for our offsite event. We look forward to seeing you there!

Don't forget to register for the Sunday event over at the [register page]({{ site.baseurl }}/badges)!

<sup>*Unfortunately, the Biodôme will be closed for renovation while we are there</sup>
