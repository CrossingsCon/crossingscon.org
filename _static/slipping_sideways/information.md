        Since many attendees are likely unfamiliar with Gather we want to make sure everyone is able to become comfortable with the platform. There are also some tutorials on their <a href="https://support.gather.town/help/movement-and-basics">info centre</a> that go over the basics.

          Gather gives you a virtual avatar to move around a virtual 2-dimensional space. You can move your avatar with either the arrow keys or the WASD keys on your keyboard. You will automatically join voice calls with other people as you approach them within a certain radius. You can press X on your keyboard to interact with various things in the space such as embedded websites or videos.
          <br><br>
          When you load into Gather you will see a screen such as this with several different menu options on the sides of the screen. These menu options are explained below.
        </div>
        <div>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Home Button</b>: Shows several links, including the Gather homepage.</li>
            <li><b>Settings</b>: Control your personal settings, such as audio and video inputs.<br><img src="/images/gather/settings.png"></li>
            <li><b>Build Tool</b>: Allows one to edit the Gather space. This will be disabled during the convention.</li>
            <li><b>Calendar</b>: Shows the day's upcoming events. Also shows one how to get to the room an event is taking place in, or else teleport there directly.<br><img src="/images/gather/calendar.png" ></li>
            <li><b>Chat</b>: Allows one to send text chat. Text chat can be done to a variety of different targets: individual users, your nearby area, everyone in the room, etc. Please use the different options appropriately.<br><img src="/images/gather/chat.png" ></li>
            <li><b>User Directory</b>: Lists all the people in the Gather space. You can direct-message people, use the follow feature to have your avatar automatically follow theirs, and more. Note the ability to block a user, which prevents you from joining voice and video calls with them.<br><img src="/images/gather/directory.png" ></li>
            <li><b>Avatar Options</b>: Allows you to change your name and your avatar.</li>
            <li><b>Quick Settings</b>: Shows some quick settings you can change such as a status or setting yourself as away.<br><img src="/images/gather/quick-settings.png" ></li>
            <li><b>Minimap</b>: Shows a minimap view of the room you're currently in.<br><img src="/images/gather/minimap.png" ></li>
            <li><b>Reactions</b>: Shows buttons to make your avatar perform reactions, such as raising your hand.<br><img src="/images/gather/reactions.png" ></li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
          There are also some special types of tiles:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Spotlights</b>: When someone steps on a spotlight tile their audio and video is broadcast to the entire room. You should never step on these tiles unless directed to by a CrossingsCon staff member.<br><img src="/images/gather/spotlight.png" ></li>
            <li><b>Private areas</b>: Areas with darkened floors allow people within them to have a private conversation without any passers-by listening in.<br><img src="/images/gather/private.png" ></li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div>
          And some other controls that may be useful to know:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Bubbles</b>: Double-clicking on another user will start a "bubble", quieting people around you for a quick conversation. Other people can still hear you (albeit faintly), and can double-click on you to join the bubble</li>
            <li><b>Ghost mode</b>: Normally you cannot move through a space where another person is standing, but holding the G key on your keyboard will allow you to move through people, to prevent you from getting stuck.</li>
            <li><b>Dancing</b>: Just for fun, repeatedly pressing the Z key will make your avatar dance!</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

        Here are some tools that are recommended to make the online convention fit your needs.<br><br>
        If you require captions for auditory events, Google Chrome has a built-in live captioning feature which you can enable <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/10538231?hl=en">by following the guide here</a>. The CrossingsCon staff have tested that this works well in Gather. In addition, all of the social spaces in the virtual convention space will have sections that are explicitly intended and labelled for text-only conversations.<br><br>
        If you've got a form of colorblindness and are finding that parts of the virtual convention space are confusing because of this, we recommend browser extensions such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/let-s-get-color-blind/">this one</a> for Firefox or <a href="">this one</a> for Chrome, or operating-system programs such as <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sim-daltonism/id693112260?mt=12">Sim Daltonism</a> for MacOS or Windows 10's <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/use-color-filters-in-windows-10-43893e44-b8b3-2e27-1a29-b0c15ef0e5ce">color filters</a> to adjust colors to suit your needs.

        The full list of convention rules can be found on the main <a href="/events/rules/">rules page</a> and every attendee is expected to be familiar with them. However, we'd like to highlight some rules that are unique to this year's convention due to it's unique virtual nature:
        <ul>
          <li>The public spaces in the virtual convention space will be considered all-ages</li>
          <li>The following topics and activities must be contained to a GatherTown private space containing only other con-goers that are comfortable with engaging with the activity or topic. Private spaces are special areas where only the people in the private space can hear and see each other, and not any passers-by.
          <ul>
            <li>On-screen consumption of controlled substances such as alcohol or tobacco, regardless of the legal age of consumption in the person's country of residence.</li>
            <li>Discussion of 18+ topics such as sex, kink, alcohol or cannabis use, etc. Note that this does not include discussions of sexuality or one's experience with gender, which are actively welcomed in all-ages spaces.</li>
          </ul></li>
