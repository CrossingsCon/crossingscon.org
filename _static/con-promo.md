If you're enjoying the book club and wish you could do the same thing but much longer and face-to-face - well then I have good news for you!

The organizers of the book club also run **CrossingsCon**, a literature convention focused around science fiction, fantasy and other speculative fiction. CrossingsCon is a place to bring together ideas and interests from across the known universes and see what new ideas and insights they produce; a place to celebrate the people we are and the people we want to be; and a place to hang out with a hundred friends you havenâ€™t met yet.


The next CrossingsCon will take place in **August 2025**, exact dates and location are still to be announced. If you're interesting in learning more and keeping up to date with news, visit the website for the con [crossingscon.org](https://crossingscon.org)
