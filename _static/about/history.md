title: The History of CrossingsCon
---

In 2013, a fateful chain of posts was made on Tumblr. (Insert link to post and maybe a screenshot here.) And thus was born CrossingsCon.

We held the first CrossingsCon on June 24-26, 2016 in Newark, NJ. You can see pictures and other stuff at this link. Our final attendance was 125 attendees and 9 staff.

The next CrossingsCon is coming up in 2017. See you there!
