CrossingsCon is a joy to put on but it takes a lot of work to make it happen. If you want to help make what we do possible, please consider donating to our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/emfozzing) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/emfozzing). We use your generous support both to make CrossingsCon a reality as well as our sister project [Linguistics After Dark](https://linguisticsafterdark.com/).

Some examples of things we've been able to do in the past that would not have been possible without your generous support include:
- Pay for many beloved authors to be able to attend CrossingsCon
- Improve the equipment and production value of Linguistics After Dark
- Subsidize costs for attendees who might not otherwise have been able to attend CrossingsCon
- Organize offsites at conventions, like whale watching in the Pacific ocean or visiting Montr√©al's amazing biodome
- Run an online monthly [book club]({{ site.baseurl }}/community/book_club) in our own virtual library
- Make the very first CrossingsCon a reality in the first place!
