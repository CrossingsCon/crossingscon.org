**When and where is CrossingsCon?**

CrossingsCon 2017 is August 4–August 6, 2017 at the beautiful Courtyard Long Beach Downtown, 500 East First Street, Long Beach, CA 90802. Details at our [location page](/location)
How much do badges cost?
Adult badges (12 years and up) are $50 USD. Child badges (3-11 years old) are $30 (when purchased with an adult badge.) Badges for anyone under 3 years old are free, but you still need to register them with an adult badge. Get them [here](https://crossingscon-2017.eventbrite.com/?aff=site)!

**Will there be on-site registration?**

Yes, in that all of our registration is done online through [Eventbrite](https://crossingscon-2017.eventbrite.com/?aff=site), and that site will remain live throughout the weekend, so you can register on a phone or computer on-site, and check in whenever our registration desk is open. However, we strongly encourage you to register as soon as you can so that we can plan as accurately as possible.

**How do I sign up for Sunday activities?**

Sunday off-site activities are “add-ons” through the Eventbrite registration process. Once you’ve selected your badge(s) (but before you pay), you can choose which off-site activities you want to sign up for. (There will also be things going on at the hotel, for no extra cost, for which you do not need to sign up separately.) If you have trouble with the add-ons or need to change your sign-up for any reason, please contact <registration@crossingscon.org>.

**When should I arrive?**

Our programming will begin at 10:00 Friday morning, so definitely before then! Depending on your travel options, you might want to arrive Thursday afternoon/evening to check in to the hotel and get yourself settled, but that is up to you. Convention registration/check-in will begin Friday morning at 9:00.

**When should I leave?**

Our closing ceremonies will be Sunday evening, mostly likely between 5:00 and 6:00pm, depending on when the off-site programming ends and we arrive back to the hotel. Our hotel block runs from August 3-7, so you are welcome to stay Sunday night if you prefer to leave on Monday, or you can head out Sunday evening.

**How do I get to the hotel?**

Depending on how far away you’re coming from, there are [a bunch of different ways to get to CrossingsCon!](/location/getting-to-the-con/)

**What size shirt should I order?**

Our shirts come in unisex cut (sizes S–5XL, [sizing chart](http://www.mygildan.com/store/us/browse/productDetailsPage.jsp?productId=5000)) and women’s cut (sizes S–3XL, [sizing chart](http://www.mygildan.com/store/us/browse/productDetailsPage.jsp?productId=5000L)).

**Can I buy merch if I’m not coming to the con?**

Unfortunately, due to tax restrictions, we cannot ship any merchandise, which means that all merch must be picked up in-person at the con. If you’re not coming this year, we encourage you to find a cousin who is going and ask them to pre-order and then pick up your swag for you. Make sure they include the pre-order with their badge, as we can’t otherwise guarantee size/flavor availability for T-shirts or tea!
