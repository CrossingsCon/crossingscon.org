Going to a convention is a big expense, and we want to make CrossingsCon as accessible as possible for all our attendees. In the spirit of building community and reducing entropy for everyone, this year we are introducing a **badge scholarship fund**.

## How do I donate?
When you [buy your badge]({{ site.baseurl }}/badges), you will have the option to donate money to the badge scholarship fund. (You can also come back and donate later.) Your donated money will be used to help pay for badges and tickets for people who would have financial trouble coming to the con otherwise. We will also use the fund to donate some badges to [Con or Bust](http://con-or-bust.org/).

## How can I get a scholarship badge?
Contact us at [scholarship@crossingscon.org](mailto:scholarship@crossingscon.org) and tell us a bit about yourself: What assistance do you need? Are you a first-time congoer, or do you go to conventions often? What's your relationship with the Young Wizards books and the works of our Guests of Honor?

On receiving your request, we will put you on the list of potential scholarship recipients, and notify you when we have the donations to support giving you a scholarship badge.
