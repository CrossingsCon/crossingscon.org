Going to a convention is a big expense, and we want to make CrossingsCon as accessible as possible for all our attendees. In the spirit of building community and reducing entropy for everyone, this year we are introducing a **badge scholarship fund**.

## How do I donate?
When you [buy your badge]({{ site.baseurl }}/badges), you will have the option to donate money to the badge scholarship fund. (You can also come back and donate later.) Your donated money will be used to help pay for badges and tickets for people who would have financial trouble coming to the con otherwise. We will also use the fund to donate some badges to [Con or Bust](http://con-or-bust.org/).

## How can I get a scholarship badge?
As the con is coming up very soon we have closed applications for new scholarship recipients. However, we are still accepting donations to aid the people to whom we have already awarded scholarships.
