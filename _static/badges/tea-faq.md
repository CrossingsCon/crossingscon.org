**Q: Where is this tea coming from?**

A: It comes from [Adagio](http://adagio.com), a fantastic company that sells high-quality loose leaf tea sourced directly from farmers. Following the introduction of DIY custom blends on their site, "fandom tea"—i.e. custom blends based on characters from books and television shows—became a hit, and they have really gone above and beyond to make it fun and easy process in which to participate, either as a blender/creator or as a consumer/fan.
 
**Q: What do you mean "loose leaf" tea?**

A: Loose leaf tea is tea that is not contained inside teabags. In the case of the fandom samplers, it is a small tin, give-or-take the size of an Altoids tin, filled to bursting with the whole tea leaves (and whatever herbs and fruits are part of the blend as well). Tea leaves are considered to fare better when they are not crushed to fit into a teabag and when they are given substantial room to unfurl in hot water while steeping.
 
You can steep loose leaf tea directly in a teapot and pour it through a strainer into your cup, or you can place a small strainer/tea ball made for this purpose directly in the teapot/mug. Adagio (and other companies) sell these, as well as paper filters, kind of like fill-it-yourself teabags, which can be more convenient if you are making many flavors at once (like for a large group) or if you are taking your tea on-the-go and don’t want to take your metal strainer with you.
 
Unfortunately, we will not have any filters or strainers for sale at CrossingsCon, but if you place a pre-order, you should have plenty of time to a strainer or some filters if you need them before you get your tea! (And truth be told, coffee filters from a grocery store can be tied/stapled into a decent teabag if you have those on-hand!)
 
**Q: Where did the Young Wizards tea come from?**

A: CrossingsCon staffer [Sarah](http://jenesaispourquoi.tumblr.com) was getting into tea just as Adagio’s fandom blends took off, and she has been creating Young Wizards themed blends ever since! You can see all the blends we are selling from her Young Wizards collection [here](https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/group.html?group=347). See below for info about some secret bonus flavors...
 
**Q: Who made the spiffy artwork for the covers of the tins?**

A: Sarah did the text, but the beautiful drawings were done by [yix](http://sheeplocked.tumblr.com). If you have a favorite or just think they are all awesome, please drop her a message and tell her so!
 
**Q: I can’t make it CrossingsCon this year D: / I have tasted some of these flavors already and want more than just a sample tin :D — Is there any other way to get these teas and still support CrossingsCon?**

A: Yes! Fear not. If you can’t make it to the con this year, we will miss you dearly, but we don’t want you to miss out on delicious tea! Adagio has an awesome program called ChariTEA, where custom blends can be linked to a non-profit, and Adagio will make a small donation to that non-profit with every purchase of blend connected to them.
 
All the Young Wizards teas have been linked to Emfozzing Enterprises, the non-profit that puts on the CrossingsCon event, so a portion of any purchases *you* make of Young Wizards tea will go to support CrossingsCon!
 
If you *are* coming to the con and you want sample tins, we ask that you order them through our Eventbrite for pick-up on-site, because we get more of the money that way. (Also, it saves you shipping costs!) However, if you are not coming, or if you want larger quantities of tea, please feel free to order them through Adagio directly!
 
**Q: Hey wait a minute, you said something about SECRET BONUS FLAVORS...?**

A: Oh yes, I almost forgot...
In addition to fandom *flavors* of tea, Adagio has so fully embraced fandom culture that they have special "fans only" areas—fandom tea creators can set certain flavors aside, accessible only to those who answer a few questions about the fandom. If you [join the official YW fandom](https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/join_the_fandom.html?group=347) on Adagio, you will get access to flavors not yet available to the general public! (There are 6 multiple choice questions, which are based on the first book. You can also take as many tries as necessary to answer them correctly.)
 
These flavors do not yet have fancy artwork, and are still under construction, but they do support ChariTEA at double the rate of the normal flavors, so please take a look! Also, if you have requests/suggestions/feedback about those flavors, leave a review or send Sarah a message, and she will take them into consideration when producing the next batch of flavors for CrossingsCon!
 
**Q: My question isn’t on here.**

A: Questions about the contents of the tea or using Adagio can be directed to <sarah@crossingscon.org>. Questions about pre-ordering through Eventbrite can be directed to <registration@crossingscon.org>. Questions about CrossingsCon in general can be directed to <info@crossingscon.org>.
