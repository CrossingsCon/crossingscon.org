While you're buying your badge, why not take the opportunity to get yourself some sweet CrossingsCon swag to go with it?

Merchandise can be pre-ordered below or [on our online store](https://store.crossingscon.org) and will be available for pickup at CrossingsCon. Prices listed include tax and are in US dollars. All you'll need to pick up your merch is the order number of your order (or orders), all payments for pre-ordered merch will be online.

You can pre-order merch separate from buying your badge. You can even order merch without buying a badge at all, though you'll have to make your own arrangements to have someone pick it up for you. Be aware that while some merchandise will be available for purchase at the convention, not all will be. Pre-ordering is the only way you guarantee you get the merch you want.

If you have any questions reach out to <info@crossingscon.org> or <merch@crossingscon.org>.
