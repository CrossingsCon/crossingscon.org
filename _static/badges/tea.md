## New Flavors

![Ed label][ed]{: .tea-label}
[Ed](https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/blend.html?blend=120443): The Master Shark doesn't need any caffeine to keep him going. In fact, this herbal blend reflects his preternatural calm. Be careful, though! Blood orange and red peppercorns provide a bit of a "bite" to keep you on your toes. [Green rooibos bonita](https://www.adagio.com/rooibos/green_rooibos_bonita.html), [honeybush vanilla](https://www.adagio.com/rooibos/honeybush_vanilla.html), [blood orange](https://www.adagio.com/herbal/blood_orange.html) with red peppercorn.

![S'reee label][s'reee]{: .tea-label}
[S’reee](https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/blend.html?blend=121593): Fun and fruity, this young Senior's blend sings of days on the beach and relaxing with friends. Naturally sweet and caffeine-free, good for a cool head in a crisis, or just chilling out. Also delicious iced! [Mango melange](https://www.adagio.com/herbal/mango_melange.html), [watermelon cooler](https://www.adagio.com/herbal/watermelon_cooler.html), [lemon grass](https://www.adagio.com/herbal/lemon_grass.html) with pineapple.

![Carl label][carl]{: .tea-label}
[Carl Romeo](https://www.adagio.com/signature_blend/blend.html?blend=121663): Stressed out about a project? Agreed to do something you wish you hadn't? Feeling afraid? Carl Romeo is here to comfort and calm you, focus and fortify you. He'd sell you some extra time if he could, but you'll just have to make do with this toasty cocoa mate, deepened with pu-erh and smoothed out with cream. It is high in caffeine, but should leave you less jittery than coffee. [Mocha nut mate](https://www.adagio.com/herbal/mocha_nut_mate.html), [pu erh dante](https://www.adagio.com/pu_erh/pu_erh_dante.html), [cream](https://www.adagio.com/flavors/cream.html) with cocoa nibs.

Friendly and nutty, to help you keep up with all the squirrels that must be chased, and sweet and comforting, for when someone you love becomes something even greater. Blueberry tea and cornflowers can't quite measure up to the Crossings' blue food, but it's pretty close.
