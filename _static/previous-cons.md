      <p class="card-text">Friday is built around saying hi to old cousins and meeting new ones! We introduce our Guests of Honor at opening ceremonies, play games with each other, and have a variety of panels, activities, and book signings. Activities typically go long into the night on the first day of the con!</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Saturday</h5>
      <p class="card-text">On Saturday, we kick it up a notch. We have stories, discussions, panels, and highly-requested attendee-led lightning talks. On Saturday night, we play tabletop games and hang out until the hotel kicks us back to our rooms.</p>

      <p class="card-text">Even though it's the last day of the con, day three doesn't have us slowing down. We usually have a group excursion on Sunday, which gives us one last chance to hang out and build amazing memories together before we head home! So far, we have explored Manhattan, the Aquarium of the Pacific, and the Montréal Space for Life.</p>
      <p class="card-text">At the end of the day we have closing ceremonies, and we finish out the con with our (unofficial) post-con party somewhere nearby.</p>

## History of the Con

In 2013, [a fateful chain of posts](https://dispatchrabbi.tumblr.com/post/52352879845/woven-from-sapphire-fiber-robotamputee) was made on Tumblr. Determined to make the words into reality, a group of Young Wizards fans got together and planned the first CrossingsCon. We arranged an Indiegogo fund drive for start-up money and got almost twice as much as we asked for! Turns out, a lot of other cousins out there wanted to see CrossingsCon happen too. With that, we set our sights on Manhattan…

### 2016: Newark, NJ

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/carousel/2016-audience.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Attendees laughing during a panel">

We held the first CrossingsCon on June 24-26, 2016 in Newark, NJ with 125 cousins attending, 9 CrossingsCon staff minding the gates, and special guests Mark Oshiro, Seanan McGuire, and (via Skype) Diane Duane.

We spent the first two days telling stories, getting to know each other, and playing games at the Courtyard Marriott in Newark. On Sunday, 90 of us ventured into Manhattan to tour the city and see landmarks from _So You Want To Be A Wizard_. We visited Rockefeller Plaza, side-eyed the CBS building, had a scavenger hunt in Grand Central Terminal, explored the New York Public Library, and checked every bathroom in the American Museum of Natural History for wormholes to other planets.

### 2017: Long Beach, CA

After having such a great first year in 2016, we couldn’t wait to see all our cousins again! We held a submarine intervention on August 4-6, 2017 in Long Beach, CA with special guests Mark Oshiro and Emily Skrutskie, 11 CrossingsCon Staff, and 55 cousins!
We had two days of panels, games, and puns at the Courtyard Marriott in Downtown Long Beach. Then, on Sunday, we walked to the Aquarium of the Pacific to spend the day conversing with our aquatic cousins! 40 of us also took an afternoon cruise and got to exchange spelling tips with the local whale and dolphin wizards!

<!-- ## 2018: Summer Meetups
After the 2017 convention, the CrossingsCon staff made the decision to hold CrossingsCon every other year in order to make the convention better and more accessible to attendees. However, two years is a long time to go without seeing your cousins, so we’re hosting meetups across the continental U.S. over the course of the summer!

### 2019: Montréal, Canada

The CrossingsCon staff made the decision to hold CrossingsCon every other year after the 2017 convention. After a long wait, CrossingsCon 2019 was held in beautiful Montréal, Canada on June 21-23, with more than 100 attendees, 12 CrossingsCon Staff, as well as special guests Mark Oshiro, Kate Howells, and Diane Duane (in person!)! 2019 was an action-packed weekend of panels, stories and much fun. On Sunday we took a tour of Montréal’s Space for Life botanical gardens, visiting Filif’s extended cousins, as well as seeing a show at the planetarium.

### 2021: Slipping Sideways

Due to the pandemic, we decided to postpone our in-person convention to 2022 and held a virtual Slipping Sideways convention on gather.town. We spread out the con over a week, and were able to host 6 Guests of Honor virtually! Diane Duane, Ursula Vernon, Megan Whalen Turner, C.B. Lee, Cat Valente, and Jessica Day George were all able to join us, as well as 70 attendees and 12 staff and volunteer moderators. Our Gather space had several panel rooms as well as a library with functional games, teleportation, and hidden easter eggs such as a duck pond livestream in the park.

### 2022: Montréal, Canada

After having been postponed, we were able to finally have our convention in-person again! CrossingsCon 2022 was held in Montréal, Canada once more on August 5-7, with more than 70 attendees, 11 CrossingsCon Staff, as well as Guests of Honor Megan Whalen Turner, Ursula Vernon, and Diane Duane. On Sunday we explored Montréal’s Biodôme, which mostly entailed hiding in the penguin exhibit to beat the heat.
