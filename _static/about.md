<!-- CrossingsCon is, first and foremost, this universe’s only convention inspired by Diane Duane’s Young Wizards.

More specifically, CrossingsCon is a moment out of time, where people can come together to share their Art and have fun doing it. It’s a place where, just for a weekend, the wizardry that is usually just around the corner is instead right in front of you. Inspired by the Young Wizards series and other stories, we celebrate the power of storytelling to literally change our lives and the world around us. The Crossings is a huge melting pot of cultures, people, and ideas, and we strive to emulate it to the extent we can (although as yet we are limited to planet Earth). We look forward to greeting cousins we know and welcoming cousins we haven’t met yet, because in hearing their stories, we become family. -->

From Shelley and Heinlein to Tolkien and Jemisin—and everywhere in between—CrossingsCon is a place to explore our world and many others through the lens of science fiction, fantasy, and other speculative fiction. While we will forever be this universe's first Young Wizards convention, we have grown into something bigger—a crossroads, much like our namesake: a place to bring together ideas and interests from across the known universes and see what new ideas and insights they produce; a place to celebrate the people we are and the people we want to be; and a place to hang out with a hundred friends you haven’t met yet.
