CrossingsCon is, first and foremost, this universe’s only convention founded on Diane Duane's Young Wizards. Year Three is taking place June 21-23, 2019 in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. [Get your ticket now!]({{ site.baseurl }}/badges)

More specifically, CrossingsCon is a moment out of time, where people can come together to share their Art and have fun doing it. It’s a place where, just for a weekend, the wizardry that is usually just around the corner is instead right in front of you. Inspired by the Young Wizards series and other stories, we celebrate the power of storytelling to literally change our lives and the world around us. The Crossings is a huge melting pot of cultures, people, and ideas, and we strive to emulate it to the extent we can (although as yet we are limited to planet Earth). We look forward to greeting cousins we know and welcoming cousins we haven’t met yet, because in hearing their stories, we become family.
