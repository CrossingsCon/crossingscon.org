CrossingsCon is this universe's only Young Wizards convention! We are a convention celebrating the works of Diane Duane,
along with all kinds of storytelling that causes us to think about the world in a different way.

We held the first CrossingsCon on June 24-26, 2016 in Newark, NJ, and we're working on Year Two, so stay tuned!
