CrossingsCon also runs a semi-frequent book club to get the community together and share our mutual love of stories. The book club takes place on Gather, the same platform we used for the 2021 virtual convention, and you can join the room for the book club [here](https://app.gather.town/app/UTJowCQNBVZCyla3/CrossingsCon%20Bookclub).

The next book club meeting is January 20th, 2024 at 7pm EST, where we'll be discussing *The Thief* by Megan Whalen Turner. 

If you enjoy the book club and want to support what we do, consider donating to our [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/emfozzing) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/emfozzing)!
