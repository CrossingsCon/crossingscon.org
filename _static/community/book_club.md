CrossingsCon runs a semi-frequent book club that aims to get the community together and share our mutual love of stories in the time between conventions. The book club takes place on Gather, the same platform we used for the 2021 virtual convention, and you can join the room for the book club [here](https://app.gather.town/app/UTJowCQNBVZCyla3/CrossingsCon%20Bookclub).

The next book club meeting is January 20th, 2024 at 7pm EST, where we'll be discussing *The Thief* by Megan Whalen Turner. 

### Support the book Club

If you enjoy the book club and want to help make it possible, consider donating to our [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/emfozzing) or [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/emfozzing)! The club is a lot of work to put together, so any support you're willing to give is hugely appreciated.

### Using the Gather space

Gather is a virtual hangout space where you can move a little avatar of yourself around a room. You can use the W, A, S and D keys to move your avatar around, with each key mapping to Up, Left, Down and Right respectively. You'll use the X key to interact with some objects in the room.

Gather will automatically connect voice and video calls with other people you pass by in the space, mimicing the experience of walking around a physical space together. You may also notice some areas where the ground is shaded darker: these are private spaces where everyone in the same space is connected regardless of distance.

If you get lost in the gather space, here's a map of the entire thing! The central hangout area is where the majority of discussion will take place, with smaller breakout spaces in the cafe at the top of the map and in the little cubbies on the side.
