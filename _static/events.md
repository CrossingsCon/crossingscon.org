Well here we have it cousins! [This](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZeF_j-tIpx5MelNDfgP-lPOSY9hq376gwLbvGEmVeEo) is the working schedule for CrossingsCon 2017. The document linked there is still undergoing some minor changes as a few more events get finalized and slotted into place, and times may change in a minor way, but for the most part… ta da! This is what CrossingsCon 2017 will look like!

For ease of access, here are PDFs of the schedule as it exists on the 7th of July. We will update these PDFs regularly as events are finalized, but you can always check the link above for the most up-to-date information!
