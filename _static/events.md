      <h5 class="card-title">Friday</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Friday is built around saying hi to old cousins and meeting new ones! We'll introduce our Guests of Honor at opening ceremonies, play games with each other, and have a variety of panels, activities, and book signings.</p>
      <p class="card-text">We've got a lot of cool stuff on the schedule for Friday (which we'll be revealing as the year goes on) â€” and make sure you're well rested, because we'll be going long into the night!</p>

    <div class="card-body">
      <h5 class="card-title">Saturday</h5>
      <p class="card-text">On Saturday, we kick it up a notch. We'll have stories, discussions, panels, and the highly-requested return of lightning talks. And there's a secret conwide event we have planned that you're going to want to come prepared for. On Saturday night, we'll play games (<i>Cards Against Errantry</i>, anyone?) and hang out until the hotel kicks us back to our rooms.</p>

      <h5 class="card-title">Sunday</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Day three has us leaving the hotel and striking out into Montreal's gorgeous Space For Life. You'll have the option of joining a group or going off on your own as we tour the planetarium and insectarium. We'll also go on a guided tour through the amazing botanical gardens.</p>
      <p class="card-text">After we've explored the Space for Life thoroughly, we'll ring out CrossingsCon 2019 with closing ceremonies, and we'll finish with our post-con party (a.k.a. dead dog) somewhere nearby.</p>
