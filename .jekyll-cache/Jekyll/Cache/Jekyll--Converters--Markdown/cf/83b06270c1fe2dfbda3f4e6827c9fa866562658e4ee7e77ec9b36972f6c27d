I"à<p>An unconvention is an event at a con where attendees present to their fellow attendees, talking about whatever they want: from poetry slams to animal sustainability to kite flying, anything and everything is welcome.</p>

<p>Like previous years, weâ€™ll be blocking off time on several different days of CrossingsCon 2021 for unconventions. You can sign up for up to two 30-minute slots <a href="https://calendly.com/emfozzing/unconvention?month=2021-08">at this link</a>.</p>
