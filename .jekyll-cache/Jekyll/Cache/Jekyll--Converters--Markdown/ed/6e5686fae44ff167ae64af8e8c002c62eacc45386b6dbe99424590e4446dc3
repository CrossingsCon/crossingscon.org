    <h5 class="mt-3 mt-md-0">Diane Duane</h5>
    <p>Appearing at CrossingsCon now for the fourth time, is the one and only Diane Duane! Diane is now in her fourth decade as a writer of science fiction and fantasy. She is the creator of the <em>Young Wizards</em> YA science fantasy series (now up to volume 10) and the <em>Middle Kingdoms</em> LGBTQ adult-fantasy series (three main-sequence novels and various long and short interstitial fiction), and has also worked in comics and computer games. She has also written extensively for television and film, working with characters ranging from Jean-Luc Picard to Batman and from Siegfried the Volsung to Scooby-Doo. She has picked up various awards for her prose and screen work over time, the most recent of these being the Faust Grandmaster Award from the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers. She also served as a writer guest of honor at the World Science Fiction Convention in Dublin in 2019.</p>

<p>Born and raised in the New York suburbs, DD lived and worked in Manhattan, Philadelphia, and the Los Angeles area before finally relocating to Europe in 1987 and Ireland in 1988. She has lived there ever since with her husband of more than thirty years, the novelist and screenwriter Peter Morwood. From an unusually device-heavy cottage in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains they casually pursue total galactic domination and the perfect home-baked loaf of bread, with the occasional trip to the Continent for long dining-car lunches and business meetings in the Alps with the Transcendent Pig.</p>

<p>DD’s favorite color is blue, her favorite food is a weird Swiss scrambled-potato dish called maluns, and her sign is RUNWAY 22R: HOLD FOR CLEARANCE.</p>

    <p><a href="https://cb-lee.com">C.B. Lee</a> is a Lambda Literary Award nominated writer of young adult science fiction and fantasy. Her works include the <em>Sidekick Squad series</em>, <em>Ben 10</em> graphic novels, <em>Out Now: Queer We Go Again</em>, <em>Minecraft: The Shipwreck</em>, <em>From A Certain Point Of View: The Empire Strikes Back</em>, and <em>A Clash of Steel: A Treasure Island Remix</em>. Lee’s work has been featured in Teen Vogue, Wired Magazine, Hypable, Tor’s Best of Fantasy and Sci Fi, and the American Library Association’s Rainbow List.</p>

<p>For CB, the “slipping sideways” theme is particularly exciting since she is working right now on a book that focuses on liminal spaces and travel between worlds.</p>

    <p>Megan Whalen Turner is an award winning and NYT bestselling author of fantasy for children, adults and young adults. Her novel, <em>The Thief</em> was a Newbery Honor book in 1997. It was the first of six books set in the world of the Queen’s Thief. Turner has been awarded a Horn Book Honor, been shortlisted twice for the Norton Award and won both the Mythopoeic Award and the LA Times Book Award for Young Adult Literature. Satisfying for all ages, her books are filled with political machinations and divine intervention, friendship, fortitude and deceit.
