I"î<p>Modern usage got you tense? Canâ€™t start up your conjugator? Or maybe youâ€™d just like to make like a schwa and destress. Submit questions to the Linguistics After Dark live show with your burning language questions, and Sarah and Eli will answer them for you. Just one catch: they canâ€™t do any research before answering. If your language is making a funny noise, theyâ€™ll get to the bottom of it, with some rowdy discussion, bad nerdy jokes, and a lot of linguistics along the way</p>
