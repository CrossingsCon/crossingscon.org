    Appearing in person at CrossingsCon now for the second time, Diane is the beloved creatrix of the series that makes us laugh, cry, question our place in the Universe, and wait for our cats to talk back (in a language we understand): the *Young Wizards* series.

    Diane Duane has been writing for books, comics, film, and TV for over 30 years. In addition to the 11-and-counting books in the *Young Wizards* series, she has written numerous other books, including some of the best-loved *Star Trek* novels. In addition to her work on *Star Trek*, she has contributed to other beloved sci-fi/fantasy series favorites including *Spider-Man*, *the X-Men*, *Transformers*, *My Little Pony*, *Duck Tales*, and others. Diane has received many awards and award nominations, and appeared regularly on the New York Times Bestseller list.

    Making his fourth appearance at CrossingsCon is Mark Oshiro, the Hugo finalist (in the Fan Writer category) creator of the online Mark Does Stuff universe (Mark Reads and Mark Watches), where he analyzes book and television series unspoiled. He was the nonfiction editor of *Queers Destroy Science Fiction!* and the co-editor of *Speculative Fiction 2015* with Foz Meadows. He is the President of the [Con or Bust](http://con-or-bust.org/about/) Board of Directors. His first novel, *Anger is a Gift*, is a YA contemporary about queer friendship, love, and fighting police brutality. When he is not writing, crying on camera about fictional characters, or ruining lives at conventions, he is busy trying to fulfill his lifelong goal: to pet every dog in the world.

    We are so excited to have Mark Oshiro return for CrossingsCon 2021! Find Mark on his [website](http://www.markoshiro.com) or the places where he [Does](http://markreads.net) [Stuff.](http://markwatches.net)

#   bio: |
#     Seanan McGuire is an American author, and the vanguard of an invading race of alien plant
#     people which will soon arrive to darken the skies of this world. She is very sorry about
#     any trouble this may cause. While waiting for the invasion, she writes books (an average
#     of five to seven per year, which is ridiculous), watches a lot of horror movies, and spends
#     far too much time playing with her abnormally large Maine Coon cats. They’re enormous.

#     Seanan enjoys travel, and is really looking forward to seeing you all at CrossingsCon,
#     where she will probably figure out something ridiculous to do in a local swamp. Because
#     that’s just the sort of person she is.

#     Take a look at her [website](http://www.seananmcguire.com/), [Tumblr](http://seananmcguire.tumblr.com/),
