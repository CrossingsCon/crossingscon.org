  bio: |
    Temp temp temp temp temp Diane Duane (born May 18, 1952) is an American science fiction
    and fantasy author. Her works include the Young Wizards young adult fantasy series and
    the Rihannsu Star Trek novels.

    Born in New York City, she grew up in Roosevelt, Long Island. After school, she studied
    nursing and practiced as a psychiatric nurse for two years until 1976, when she moved to
    California and worked as an assistant to David Gerrold. Her first novel was published by
    Dell Books in 1979; Gerrold wrote an "overture" to that novel, on the grounds that he'd
    rather be making overtures than introductions to Duane.[1] She subsequently worked as a
    freelance writer. In 1981 she moved to Pennsylvania. She married Northern Irish author Peter
    Morwood in 1987; they moved to the United Kingdom and then to Ireland, where she resides in
    County Wicklow.

#   bio: |
#     Seanan McGuire is an American author, and the vanguard of an invading race of alien plant
#     people which will soon arrive to darken the skies of this world. She is very sorry about
#     any trouble this may cause. While waiting for the invasion, she writes books (an average
#     of five to seven per year, which is ridiculous), watches a lot of horror movies, and spends
#     far too much time playing with her abnormally large Maine Coon cats. They’re enormous.

#     Seanan enjoys travel, and is really looking forward to seeing you all at CrossingsCon,
#     where she will probably figure out something ridiculous to do in a local swamp. Because
#     that’s just the sort of person she is.
