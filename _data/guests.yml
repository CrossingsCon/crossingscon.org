  bio: |
    Seanan McGuire is an American author, and the vanguard of an invading race of alien plant
    people which will soon arrive to darken the skies of this world. She is very sorry about
    any trouble this may cause. While waiting for the invasion, she writes books (an average
    of five to seven per year, which is ridiculous), watches a lot of horror movies, and spends
    far too much time playing with her abnormally large Maine Coon cats. They’re enormous.

    Seanan enjoys travel, and is really looking forward to seeing you all at CrossingsCon,
    where she will probably figure out something ridiculous to do in a local swamp. Because
    that’s just the sort of person she is.
