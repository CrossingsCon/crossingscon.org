    Appearing in person at CrossingsCon for the first time ever, Diane is the beloved creatrix of the series that makes us laugh, cry, question our place in the Universe, and wait for our cats to talk back (in a language we understand): the *Young Wizards* series.

    Diane Duane has been writing for books, comics, film, and TV for over 30 years. In addition to the 11-and-counting books in the *Young Wizards* series, she has written numerous other books, including some of the best-loved *Star Trek* novels. In addition to her work on *Star Trek*, she has contributed to other beloved sci-fi/fantasy series favorites including *Spider-Man*, *the X-Men*, *Transformers*, *My Little Pony*, *Duck Tales*, and others.

#   bio: |
#     Seanan McGuire is an American author, and the vanguard of an invading race of alien plant
#     people which will soon arrive to darken the skies of this world. She is very sorry about
#     any trouble this may cause. While waiting for the invasion, she writes books (an average
#     of five to seven per year, which is ridiculous), watches a lot of horror movies, and spends
#     far too much time playing with her abnormally large Maine Coon cats. They’re enormous.

#     Seanan enjoys travel, and is really looking forward to seeing you all at CrossingsCon,
#     where she will probably figure out something ridiculous to do in a local swamp. Because
#     that’s just the sort of person she is.
