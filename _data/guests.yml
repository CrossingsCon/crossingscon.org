    Kit Rodriguez isn't a wizardly slouch either, and takes the "a boy and his dog" genre to
    ridiculous extremes. Well, that's what happens when you make a leash out of the Speech.

    He lives at home with his sisters Helena and Carmela. One thinks he's a *brujo*; the other
    will either kiss or sell chocolate to everything in sight.
