  bio: |
    Diane has been a Guest of Honor for CrossingsCon in 2016, 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2022. Diane is now in her fourth decade as a writer of science fiction and fantasy. She is the creator of the *Young Wizards* YA science fantasy series (now up to volume 10) and the *Middle Kingdoms* LGBTQ adult-fantasy series (three main-sequence novels and various long and short interstitial fiction), and has also worked in comics and computer games. She has also written extensively for television and film, working with characters ranging from Jean-Luc Picard to Batman and from Siegfried the Volsung to Scooby-Doo. She has picked up various awards for her prose and screen work over time, the most recent of these being the Faust Grandmaster Award from the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers. She also served as a writer guest of honor at the World Science Fiction Convention in Dublin in 2019.

    Born and raised in the New York suburbs, DD lived and worked in Manhattan, Philadelphia, and the Los Angeles area before finally relocating to Europe in 1987 and Ireland in 1988. She has lived there ever since with her husband of more than thirty years, the novelist and screenwriter Peter Morwood. From an unusually device-heavy cottage in the foothills of the Wicklow Mountains they casually pursue total galactic domination and the perfect home-baked loaf of bread, with the occasional trip to the Continent for long dining-car lunches and business meetings in the Alps with the Transcendent Pig.

    DD’s favorite color is blue, her favorite food is a weird Swiss scrambled-potato dish called maluns, and her sign is RUNWAY 22R: HOLD FOR CLEARANCE.

    Seanan McGuire was a Guest of Honor at our first CrossingsCon in 2016. She is an American author, and the vanguard of an invading race of alien plant people which will soon arrive to darken the skies of this world. She is very sorry about any trouble this may cause. While waiting for the invasion, she writes books (an average of five to seven per year, which is ridiculous), watches a lot of horror movies, and spends far too much time playing with her abnormally large Maine Coon cats. They’re enormous.
