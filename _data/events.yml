    The Guests of Honor and others will play a live game of *The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen*, to the amusement and great merriment of their audience.

    Baron Munchausen is a game of collaborative storytelling that can result in (among many other things): gruesome death by cobra, seductive sea serpents, naked dragonriding, and undersea caverns reachable only by cobra raft. The game is played thus: one player says to another something like, “So Commodore Viragent, tell us about the time you encountered the fabled Lady of Original Curses and stole her most beloved kitten.”

    “Commodore Viragent” then has to tell that story to the best of their abilities, or, if they do not feel up to the task, they may surrender one of their three tokens to the inquiring player. More players can add twists to the stories by handing “Commodore Viragent” one of their tokens and saying something like, “I understand why you took the kitten in the first place, but once the Lady of Original Curses had caught up to you and laid upon you the Curse of Losing a Sock, and you had barely escaped with the kitten, how did you survive lopsided frostbite, hidden so deep in Antarctica?”

    When the first player feels they have told their story in full, they may then turn to another player and ask him to relate the tale of how he, a man of unusual stature, became Underprince of the Dwarven Kingdom of the High Andes.

    Baron Munchausen was a huge hit by both players and audience members alike at CrossingsCons past. We hope CrossingsCon 2019 will have some of the best adventures yet!

    Games Wizards Play gave us an example of what a wizardly science fair would look like, and we’d love to see what all of you can come up with! This Invitational will be a celebration of all things science, and everyone is invited to participate! What is your favorite science thing? Are you passionate about the life cycle of a forest? Can you talk for ages and ages about interstellar space travel? Or, if you have a way to recreate one of the projects we see in Games Wizards Play, that would be great too!

    Of course, it doesn’t have to be strictly science based! It can be in the realm of wizardry, too! If you know what the spell diagram the young wizards used on the moon at the end of Wizards at War would look like, or a spell to repair the ozone layer, give it a go!

    You can make your project ahead of time and bring it to Montréal, or there will be preparation time and space at the Con! There will be a $25 limit on supplies (don’t worry about the exchange rate unless it lets you buy that last thing you need to demonstrate how Jupiter and Saturn resonate). All projects should be leaning towards a purpose or reducing entropy in some way.

    Our judges are TBD, but everyone is welcome to walk around and observe, leave comments or tokens, or ask questions of the presenter! We can’t wait to see what you all come up with!

    Have you ever wanted to get down to the nitty-gritty of your craft with a few published authors, and really talk about what makes it work?  Mark and Diane will join us in a two-part writing workshop.  We’ll set aside some time to write a short piece in response to a prompt, then have an in-depth Q&A session with our wonderful Guests of Honor.  They’ll talk about things like research, plot development, and dialogue, and what their writing journey has looked like.

    This is a chance to talk to two authors at very different points in their publishing careers—Diane, who has an extensive repertoire spanning decades and including books, scripts for live-action and animated TV series, comics, and computer games, and Mark, who has been writing online for years but whose first book was released just last year.

    Writers of all kinds and experience welcome!
