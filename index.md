CrossingsCon 2021 will be hosted on [Gather Town](https://gather.town), a video calling platform that offers a virtual space where you can move an avatar around, automatically joining calls with people near you. We're extremely excited about what we'll be able to do with all the tools Gather Town offers, making for a convention much more than just a livestream of a couple panels and events.

If you want to learn more about Gather you can try out their [live walkthrough](https://gather.town/app/ZjoKsCgut1xMYH5L/Live%20Walkthrough) or read one of their many articles on their [support centre](https://support.gather.town/help/movement-and-basics). We're investing heavily into carefully designing our virtual convention space to let us hold the best convention we can and to fit the needs of our attendees. If you have any concerns or requests, particularly around accessibility, feel more than free to drop a line to [webmaster@crossingscon.org](mailto:webmaster@crossingscon.org) so we can try to design the space to accomodate you as best we can.

## Events

CrossingsCon 2021 will feature a mix of panels, workshops, Q&As, lectures and more. At past conventions we've had guests of honor give exclusive readings from their upcoming works, had experts do serious academic analysis of people's favourite books, musical jam sessions, live gameplay of table-top games such as The Adventures of Baron Munchausen, and more.

You can read descriptions of all events taking place at CrossingsCon 2021 [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/events), and check [the schedule]({{ site.baseurl }}/events/schedule/) for an hour-by-hour view of when events are taking place.
