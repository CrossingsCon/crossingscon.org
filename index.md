Welcome to CrossingsCon, this universe's first Young Wizards convention! CrossingsCon is two days of panels, readings, transformative works, discussions, meta, and hugs, with some wonderful special guests and a third day of offsite events.

We're still waiting to announce a lot of information up for the 2017 convention, so information around the site will be sparse. We'll be filling in the gaps as things are confirmed. In the meantime, why not [check out some recordings from 2016][youtube-playlist-2016] and get a taste of what's to come!
